# Blog Project ideas

## Motivation

I wanted have a place where put my ideas about interesting projects that I could develop in some time. For that, I decided built a blog with Next.js, Markdown and Tailwind.

## Running locally in development mode

To get started, just clone the repository and run.

```
git clone https://github.com/Edwinpgm/project-ideas.git
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Testing

We use Jest with Testing Library.

```
yarn test
```

## Linting

We use Eslint.

```
yarn lint
```
